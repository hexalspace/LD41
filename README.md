FORGET EVAHTHING

- Now doing Solataire Shooter

Definitions
---
- Rooms only know about adjacent rooms...via an offset
- Rooms are recreatable from a serializable base state, the serializable base state can change
- One such change is a wall becoming a passage to adjacent room, the transition happens and is permanent, importantly, its not the case that a passage is a wall adjacent to another room's door, it is actually a passage
- Another such change is a consumable item being consumed, it should change into empty space of some kind, so it wont be recreated later
- You can only see one room at a time
- Mini map is an actual minimap (displays rooms and connections, not cubes that makeup rooms)

Metroidvania CCG
---
- Either in platforming mode or map mode
- You collect card packs that contain rooms
- You place rooms to get to marked map areas that have keys or are the final room (need keys to enter final room)
- Infinite, if you get to goal, we simply spawn a new world with goals and keys that is bigger
- One of the rooms in card pack will contain a card pack, so you can keep collecting
- Camera follow player but sticks to room walls? Leaving room reset room state?
-
- Crazy stuff like moving rooms would be cool (have background stuff so you can tell rooms are moving)
- Map could have danger level to encourage certain pathing
- Character abilities

First Steps
---
- Player character that moves at constant speeds all directions with arrow keys
